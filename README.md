Bunch of json grabbed from scpfoundation.net for building zim for offline reading.
Used ftml lib from https://github.com/SCPru/RuFoundation/tree/master/ftml, but my implementation of `ftml2html` binary is pretty much awful due to lack of rust experience.
Also there are simple bash scripts to help with downloading and parsing json, converting it to html and creating zim
