Bunch of json grabbed from scpfoundation.net to build zim for offline reading.
Used ftml lib from https://github.com/SCPru/RuFoundation/tree/master/ftml, but my implementation of `ftml2html` binary is pretty much awful due to lack of rust experience.
Also there are simple bash scripts to help to download and parse json, convert it to html and create zim
